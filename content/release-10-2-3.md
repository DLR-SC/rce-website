We are pleased to announce the recent release of RCE 10.2.3.
In this maintenance release, we further improved the stability of uplink connections, particularly in situations with large amounts of transferred data or with low available bandwidth.
You can find the technical changelog on [github](https://github.com/rcenvironment/rce/releases/tag/release-10.2.3).

If you are using RCE 10.x you can update your installation using "Help -> Check for Updates".
Otherwise, please find the downloadable artifacts on our [download page](https://rcenvironment.de/pages/download.html).
