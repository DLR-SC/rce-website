We have fine-tuned and finalized the public beta version and are proud to announce the final release of RCE 9.0.

For now, please take a look at the [**public beta changelog**](rce-900-beta.html), wich already gives an overview of the new features and improvements.
A complete changelog will be published here soon.

**Note:** Implementing the new features of RCE 9.0 required significant changes to the way the user profiles are stored.
Hence, depending on your configuration, some manual steps may be necessary when upgrading existing profiles.
If you would like to reinstate these settings, please consult the [**Migration Guide**](pages/documentation/migration-guide.html).
Moreover, the same changes required raising the minimal required Java version to Java 8u161.
