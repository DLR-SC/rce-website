We have just released RCE 8.2.3. It adresses several security issues and significantly reduces the RAM usage of workflow and component hosts. Furthermore, network timeouts in complex workflows during the initialization phase are prevented and we have fixed an issue which did not allow to cancel a workflow during this phase.
