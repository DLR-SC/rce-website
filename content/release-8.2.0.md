RCE 8.2 is out now. We realized various new features and improvements. Here we present a selection.
Please see [GitHub](https://github.com/rcenvironment/rce/wiki/Changelog:-8.x.x-Releases) for the full changelog.

### XML Values

In this release we added a new workflow component: XML Values. This component allows you to easily access the content of XML files. Values can be inserted into a file or extracted from a file using the XPath notation as known from other components in RCE. Moreover the XPath chooser dialog was enhanced.

### Exporting directly to projects

As a usability improvement we made it easier to export your data directly into projects. This comes into effect in the export of simulation results from the Workflow Data Browser and when writing data via the Output Writer component.
