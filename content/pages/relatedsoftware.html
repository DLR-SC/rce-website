	<p>  		
	RCE is a distributed integration environment for scientists and engineers to analyze, optimize, and design complex systems like aircraft, ships, or satellites. It is especially suited for multidisciplinary collaboration. Handling complex systems requires many experts and several tools for analysis, design, and simulation. Using RCE, these tools can be shared between team members and integrated into automated, executable workflows. RCE is extensible and supports different scientific applications with a wide range of requirements.

								CPACS
							</h2>
							<p>
								The <a href="https://cpacs.de/">Common Parametric Aircraft Configuration Schema (CPACS)</a> is a data definition for the air transportation system. 
								CPACS enables engineers to exchange information between their tools. There are special wrapping functionalities for 
								CPACS implemented in RCE, making the integration of CPACS compatible tools fairly easy. RCE's CPACS Writer component saves incoming CPACS content as an 
								xml file on the local file system.

								TiGL
							</h2>
							<p>
								The <a href="https://dlr-sc.github.io/tigl/">TiGL library</a> is an open source geometric library specially developed to handle CPACS files. 
								It includes the TiGL-Viewer, an interactive user interface which can be used to inspect the CPACS geometry. Within RCE, the TiGL Viewer component 
								opens a TiGL Viewer during workflow execution to provide an integrated 3D viewer for CPACS geometries.

								IslandViz
							</h2>
							<p>
								The <a href="https://www.dlr.de/sc/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-13797/23966_read-58127/">Island Visualization (IslandViz)</a> is a visualization tool 
								for exploring modular software systems such as RCE in virtual reality. Using an island metaphor, IslandViz represents every module as a distinct island.
								The resulting island system is displayed in the confines of a virtual table, where users can explore RCE on multiple levels of granularity. 
								That allows users to get a first overview about the complexity of an OSGi-based software system 
								by interactively exploring its modules as well as the dependencies between them.
