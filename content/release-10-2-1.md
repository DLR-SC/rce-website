We are pleased to announce the recent release of RCE 10.2.1.
Besides general improvements and bugfixes regarding SSH/Uplink, we incorporated fixes for certain problems regarding timeouts and login attempts.
Furthermore we improved the event logging by adding more information and made it easier to recognize events.
We also restored previously unavailable console commands `keytool` and `sysmon`.
Moreover, we removed obsolete libraries and upgraded the OSHI library to 4.9.5, which fixes a memory leak.
In addition to that the Installation section in the User Guide was rewritten to make it more understandable.

Finally, we have extended the validity of our GPG signing key since the 10.2.0 release.
Please refer to the user guide for more information on how to use this signing key to verify your download.
