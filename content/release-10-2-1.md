We are pleased to announce the recent release of RCE 10.2.1.
Besides general bugfixes regarding SSH/Uplink, we incorporated fixes for certain problems regarding timeouts and login attempts.
Furthermore we improved the event logging by adding more information and made it easier to recognize events.
Previously unavailable console commands "keytool" and "sysmon" were restored.
We removed obsolet libraries and upgraded the OSHI library to 4.9.5, which fixes a memory leak.
In addition to that the Installation section in the User Guide was rewritten to make it more understandable.

Please also note that we have extended the validity of our GPG signing key since the 10.2.0 release.
