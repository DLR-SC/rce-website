		<h3>Information about Data Protection</h3>
		
		<p>DLR takes the protection of personal data very seriously. We want you to know when we store data, which types of data are stored and how it is used. As an incorporated entity under German civil law, we are subject to the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (refer to <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">https://gdpr-info.eu/</a>), the <a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bdsg/index.html" target="_blank">Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG)</a> and the <a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/" target="_blank">Telemedia Act (TMG)</a>. We have taken technical and organisational measures to ensure our compliance and the compliance of external service providers with the data protection regulation.</p>

		<p>This website uses SSL – that is, TLS encryption – in order to protect the transfer of personal data and other confidential information (for example, orders or enquiries sent to the controller). A connection is encrypted if you see the character sequence 'https://' and the padlock icon in your browser's address bar.</p>

		<p><strong>I. Name and address of the controller</strong></p>

		<p>The controller in the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation, other national data protection laws in the Member States and related data protection regulations is:</p>

		<p>Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e. V. (DLR)<br />
		Linder Höhe<br />
		51147 Cologne</p>

		<p>Telephone: +49 2203 601-0<br />
		Email: <a href="mailto:datenschutz@dlr.de">datenschutz@dlr.de</a><br />
		WWW: <a href="https://www.dlr.de">https://www.dlr.de</a></p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>II. Name and address of the data protection officer</strong></p>

		<p>The controller’s appointed data protection officer is:</p>

		<p>Uwe Gorschütz, Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e. V., Linder Höhe, 51147 Cologne<br />
		Email: <a href="mailto:datenschutz@dlr.de">datenschutz@dlr.de</a></p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>III. Definition of terms</strong></p>

		<p>Among others, we use the following terms in this Privacy Policy, set out in the General Data Protection Regulation and the Federal Data Protection Act:</p>

		<p><em>1. Personal data</em></p>

		<p>Personal data refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter: ‘data subject’). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified – directly or indirectly – in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>

		<p><em>2. Data subject</em></p>

		<p>A data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person whose personal data is processed by the controller.</p>

		<p><em>3. Processing</em></p>

		<p>Processing is any operation or set of operations performed on personal data or on sets of personal data – whether or not by automated means – such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, deletion or destruction.</p>

		<p><em>4. Restriction of processing</em></p>

		<p>Restriction of processing means the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting its processing in the future.</p>

		<p><em>5. Profiling</em></p>

		<p>Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.</p>

		<p><em>6. Pseudonymisation</em></p>

		<p>Pseudonymisation means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>

		<p><em>7. Controller or data processing controller</em></p>

		<p>Controller or data processing controller means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.</p>

		<p><em>8. Processor</em></p>

		<p>Processor means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the controller.</p>

		<p><em>9. Recipient</em></p>

		<p>Recipient means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities that may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients.</p>

		<p><em>10. Third party</em></p>

		<p>Third party means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.</p>

		<p><em>11.Consent</em></p>

		<p>Consent of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>IV. General information on data processing</strong></p>

		<p><em>1. Scope of processing of personal data</em></p>

		<p>We process personal data concerning our users exclusively to the extent required to provide a functioning website, as well as our content and services. Ordinarily, we will only process the personal data of our users after obtaining their consent. An exception to this rule is where obtaining prior consent is factually impossible and the processing of the data is permitted by law.</p>

		<p><em>2. Legal grounds for the processing of personal data</em></p>

		<p>Where we obtain consent from the data subject for the processing of personal data, the legal grounds are set out in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

		<p>Where personal data is processed for the performance of a contract in which the data subject is a contractual partner, the legal grounds are set out in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (b) of the GDPR. This also applies to processing that is necessary for pre-contractual measures.</p>

		<p>Where personal data is processed for compliance with a legal obligation to which our research centre is subject, the legal grounds are set out in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (c) of the GDPR.</p>

		<p>Where processing of personal data is necessary for the protection of vital interests of the data subject or another natural person, the legal grounds are set out in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (d) of the GDPR.</p>

		<p>Where processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of our research centre or a third party, and where the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the first interests, the legal grounds are set out in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (f) of the GDPR.</p>

		<p><em>3. Data deletion and duration of data storage</em></p>

		<p>The personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage no longer applies. In addition, storage takes place if authorised by Union or Member State directives, laws or other regulations to which the controller is subject. Blocking or deletion of the data shall also take place when a storage period stipulated by one of the above standards comes to an end, except where it is necessary to continue storing the data to enter into or perform a contract.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>V. Provision of the website and generation of log files</strong></p>

		<p><em>a) Description and scope of data processing</em></p>

		<p>Our system automatically collects data and information from the accessing computer system each time our website is visited.</p>

		<p>The following data is collected in this context:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Information about the browser type and version</li>
			<li>The user’s operating system</li>
			<li>The user’s Internet Service Provider</li>
			<li>The user’s IP address</li>
			<li>The date and time of access</li>
			<li>Referrer website(s)</li>
			<li>Websites accessed by the user from our website</li>
		</ol>

		<p>The data is also stored in log files kept on our system. This data is not stored together with other personal data concerning the user.</p>

		<p><em>b)&nbsp;Legal grounds for data processing</em></p>

		<p>The legal grounds for temporary storage of the data and log files are set out in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (f) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

		<p><em>c)&nbsp;Purpose of data processing</em></p>

		<p>Temporary storage of the IP address by our system is necessary to deliver the website to the computer of the user. For this purpose, the user’s IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.</p>

		<p>Storage in log files takes place to ensure functionality of the website. In addition, the data is used to optimise the website and to ensure security of our Information Technology systems. Data analysis for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.</p>

		<p>The DLR website collects a variety of general data and information each time it is accessed by a data subject or an automated system. This general data and information is stored in server log files. The data and information collected include the (1) browser types and versions; (2) the operating system used by the accessing system; (3) the website from which the accessing system arrives on our website (the referrer); (4) the sub-pages visited by the accessing system; (5) the date and time of accessing our website; (6) an Internet Protocol address (IP address); (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system and (8) other similar data and information that is used to protect against risks in the case of attacks on our Information Technology systems.</p>

		<p>DLR does not draw any conclusions about the identity of the data subject during use of this general data and information. Instead, this information is necessary to (1) deliver the contents of our website in their correct form; to (2) optimise the contents of our website and promote it; to (3) guarantee the permanent functionality of our information technology systems and equipment used for our website; and to (4) provide the information necessary for law enforcement organisations to investigate cyber-attacks. This anonymous data and information is analysed by DLR, firstly for statistical purposes, and secondly with the objective of increasing data protection and data security at our research centre, and hence to achieve an optimum level of protection for the personal data processed by us. The anonymous data contained in the server log files is stored separately from all other personal data concerning the data subject.</p>

		<p>These purposes justify our legitimate interests in data processing according to Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (f) of the GDPR.</p>

		<p><em>d) Duration of storage</em></p>

		<p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was collected. In the case of data collection for the provision of this website, this applies at the end of each session.</p>

		<p>In the case of data stored in log files, this occurs after no longer than seven days. Further storage is possible; in these cases, the users’ IP addresses are deleted or pseudonymised to prevent any association with the accessing client.</p>

		<p><em>e) Right to objection and removal</em></p>

		<p>The collection of data for the provision of our website and the storage of data in log files is crucial to operation of the website. Hence, users are not granted a right to object.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<p><strong>VI. Use of YouTube</strong></p>

		<p>The controller has integrated components of YouTube on this website. YouTube is an Internet video portal that enables video publishers to upload video clips free of charge and that permits other users to view, rate and comment on these videos, also free of charge. YouTube allows the dissemination of all kinds of videos, so that full movies and TV programmes, as well as music videos, trailers and videos produced by users, are accessible on the Internet portal.</p>

		<p>The operating company of YouTube is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. YouTube, LLC is a subsidiary of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.</p>

		<p>With each visit to one of the individual pages of this Website that are operated by the controller and on which a YouTube component (YouTube video) has been integrated, the Internet browser on the Information Technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download a display of the corresponding YouTube component.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>The embedding code for YouTube videos was generated in advanced data privacy mode (for more detailed information in this regard, visit <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780">https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780</a>).</p>

		<p>Further information about YouTube is available at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en/yt/about/">https://www.youtube.com/intl/en/yt/about/</a>. During the course of this technical procedure, YouTube and Google acquire knowledge of the specific sub-page of our website that was visited by the data subject.</p>

		<p>If the data subject is simultaneously logged into YouTube, YouTube recognises – with each visit to a sub-page that contains a YouTube video – which specific sub-page of our website the data subject visited. This information is collected by YouTube and Google and associated with the YouTube account of the data subject.</p>

		<p>YouTube and Google will receive information through the YouTube component that the data subject has visited our website if the data subject is simultaneously logged into YouTube when visiting our website; this occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on a YouTube video or not. If such a transmission of information to YouTube and Google is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she can prevent this by logging off from their YouTube account before visiting our website.</p>

		<p>YouTube’s privacy policy, which is available at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>, provides information on the collection, processing and use of personal data by YouTube and Google.</p>

		<p>The data subject has granted consent for this form of data processing by confirming the use of cookies upon first access of the DLR website. The legal basis for processing of the data after consent by the user is set out in Art. 6, paragraph 1, part (a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
